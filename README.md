Hacking Headrush PB

## wishlist
- assign tuner to volume pedal @ min
- add additional blocks to rigs
- possible workflow hacks like: "save / add rig to set list" - "Save as New Rig > add it somewhere"
- allow tuner/looper to be assigned to other functions or:
  - disable tap tempo and allow instant tuner engagement instead of long press
  - make looper to tuner / keep tap tempo (e.g.; live i would rather have tuner immediately accessible than looper)

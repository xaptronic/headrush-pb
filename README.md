Hacking Headrush PB

## wishlist
1. assign tuner to volume pedal @ min
2. add additional blocks to rigs
3. possible workflow hacks like: "save / add rig to set list" - "Save as New Rig > add it somewhere"
4. allow tuner/looper to be assigned to other functions or:
   a. disable tap tempo and allow instant tuner engagement instead of long press
   b. make looper to tuner / keep tap tempo
